- [x] Google Play Console Account ($25 one-time fee)
- [x] Google Account
- [x] Android Studio or JDK 11+ installed

### Required Files:
- [x] App built and synced (`npm run build && npx cap sync android`)
- [ ] App signing keystore (we'll create this)

## üîß STEP 1: BUILD THE APP

### 1.1 Build Web Assets
```bash
cd "ai-haloween 2"
npm run build
```

### 1.2 Sync to Android
```bash
npx cap sync android
```

### 1.3 Open in Android Studio
```bash
npx cap open android
```

---

## üîë STEP 2: CREATE SIGNING KEYSTORE

You need a keystore to sign your app for Play Store.

### 2.1 Generate Keystore

```bash
# Navigate to android/app directory
cd android/app

# Generate keystore (change passwords!)
keytool -genkey -v -keystore ai-halloween-release.keystore \
  -alias ai-halloween \
  -keyalg RSA \
  -keysize 2048 \
  -validity 10000 \
  -storepass YOUR_STRONG_PASSWORD \
  -keypass YOUR_STRONG_PASSWORD
```

**IMPORTANT**: 
- Replace `YOUR_STRONG_PASSWORD` with a strong password
- Save this password securely - you'll need it for all future updates!
- Keep the keystore file safe - if you lose it, you can't update your app!

### 2.2 Store Keystore Info

You'll be asked for:
- **First and last name**: Your name or company name
- **Organizational unit**: AI Halloween Transform
- **Organization**: Jeremy Crandall
- **City**: Your city
- **State**: Your state
- **Country code**: US (or your country)

Answer `yes` when asked if the information is correct.

---

## üìù STEP 3: CONFIGURE SIGNING

### 3.1 Create/Update gradle.properties

Edit `android/gradle.properties` or create `android/keystore.properties`:

```properties
# Keystore credentials (DO NOT COMMIT TO GIT!)
RELEASE_STORE_FILE=app/ai-halloween-release.keystore
RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD=YOUR_STRONG_PASSWORD
RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS=ai-halloween
RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD=YOUR_STRONG_PASSWORD
```

### 3.2 Update build.gradle

Edit `android/app/build.gradle` and add signing config:

```gradle
android {
    // ... existing config ...
    
    signingConfigs {
        release {
            if (project.hasProperty('RELEASE_STORE_FILE')) {
                storeFile file(RELEASE_STORE_FILE)
                storePassword RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD
                keyAlias RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS
                keyPassword RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD
            }
        }
    }
    
    buildTypes {
        release {
            signingConfig signingConfigs.release
            minifyEnabled true
            shrinkResources true
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
        }
    }
}
```

---

## üèóÔ∏è STEP 4: BUILD SIGNED APK/AAB

### Option A: Build AAB (Recommended for Play Store)

**Android App Bundle** - smaller download size, optimized per device.

```bash
cd android
./gradlew bundleRelease
```

Output: `android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`

### Option B: Build APK (For testing or direct distribution)

```bash
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

Output: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`

### Verify Signing

```bash
# For AAB
jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab

# For APK
jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

You should see "jar verified" if successful.
