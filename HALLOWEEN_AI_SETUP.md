# Halloween AI Setup - Identity Preservation System

## Overview
This Halloween app uses Google's Imagen 4.0 for image generation and Veo 2.0 for video generation, with special prompting to ensure people remain recognizable in their Halloween costumes.

## Key Features

### üéÉ Identity Preservation
The app is specifically configured to:
- Keep the original person's face and features completely unchanged
- Apply Halloween costumes as if they were wearing real store-bought outfits
- Maintain photorealistic quality - like a real Halloween party photo
- Ensure the person is instantly recognizable as themselves

### üñºÔ∏è Image Generation (Imagen 4.0)
**Model**: `imagen-4.0-generate-001`
- **Cost**: $0.04 per image
- **Purpose**: Generates realistic photos of people in Halloween costumes
- **Key Feature**: Excellent at preserving facial identity while adding costumes

The pre-prompt ensures:
- Face, body structure, and features remain EXACTLY the same
- Costume elements are added (clothing, makeup, accessories)
- Photo looks like it was taken at a real Halloween party
- No cartoonish or morphing effects

### üé¨ Video Generation (Veo 2.0)
**Model**: `veo-2.0-generate-001`
- **Cost**: ~$5.25 per 15-second video (via Gemini API)
- **Purpose**: Animates the Halloween costume photos with spooky movements
- **Duration**: 5-15 seconds of animation

The video prompt ensures:
- Person's identity remains constant throughout the video
- Halloween-themed animations (costume movements, spooky gestures)
- Atmospheric effects (fog, lightning, glowing effects)
- Maintains photorealistic quality

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
# Use Imagen 4 for better identity preservation in costumes
VITE_GEMINI_IMAGE_MODELS=imagen-4.0-generate-001,imagen-4.0-fast-001,gemini-2.5-pro
VITE_GEMINI_VIDEO_MODELS=veo-2.0-generate-001,veo-1.5-lite-001
```

### Model Selection Logic
1. **Primary**: Imagen 4.0 - Best quality and identity preservation
2. **Fallback 1**: Imagen 4.0 Fast - Faster generation if needed
3. **Fallback 2**: Gemini 2.5 Pro - If Imagen is unavailable

## Cost Optimization

### Recommended Settings
- **Images Only Mode**: $0.04 per transformation (very affordable)
- **Video Optional**: Make video generation optional due to high cost
- **Shorter Videos**: Consider 5-second videos instead of 15 seconds
- **Usage Limits**: Implement daily limits or credit system

### Cost Breakdown
- **Image Generation**: $0.04 per image ‚úÖ Affordable
- **Video Generation**: $5.25 per 15-second video ‚ö†Ô∏è Expensive
- **Complete Transformation**: ~$5.29 total

## How It Works

### 1. User Upload
User uploads a photo of themselves or someone they want to transform

### 2. Costume Selection
User selects or describes the Halloween costume they want

### 3. Image Generation
```javascript
// Imagen 4 generates the costume photo with this approach:
- Analyzes the original person's features
- Applies costume elements while preserving identity
- Outputs a realistic Halloween party photo
```

### 4. Optional Video Animation
```javascript
// Veo 2 animates the costume photo:
- Adds costume-appropriate movements
- Includes Halloween effects
- Maintains person's recognizable features
```

## Example Prompts

### Good Costume Prompts
‚úÖ "Vampire with cape and fangs"
‚úÖ "Witch with pointed hat and broomstick"
‚úÖ "Zombie with tattered clothes and makeup"
‚úÖ "Superhero in full costume with cape"
‚úÖ "Classic ghost with white sheet costume"

### What the AI Does
- **Preserves**: Face, body type, skin tone, age, gender
- **Adds**: Costume clothing, accessories, makeup, props
- **Enhances**: Background with Halloween decorations
- **Maintains**: Photo realism and natural lighting

## Important Notes

1. **API Key Required**: You need a Google AI Studio API key with access to Imagen 4 and Veo 2
2. **Identity Focus**: The system is optimized for keeping people recognizable
3. **Cost Awareness**: Video generation is expensive - consider making it premium
4. **Quality**: Imagen 4 produces higher quality results than standard Gemini models

## Troubleshooting

### Person Doesn't Look Like Themselves
- Check that Imagen 4 is being used (not falling back to Gemini)
- Ensure the pre-prompt includes identity preservation instructions
- Verify the original image is clear and well-lit

### Costume Not Appearing
- Make costume descriptions more specific
- Include details about clothing, colors, and accessories
- Avoid abstract or vague descriptions

### Video Too Expensive
- Reduce duration to 5 seconds
- Make video generation a premium feature
- Use Imagen 4 for images only (much more affordable)
