# 🎉 Vercel MCP Server - Ready to Deploy!

Your Vercel MCP server is built and ready to deploy your AI Halloween Transform app directly through Claude!

---

## 📦 What We Built

A complete **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** that gives Claude Desktop the ability to:

✅ **List and inspect Vercel projects**
✅ **Create and manage deployments**
✅ **View deployment logs and status**
✅ **Manage environment variables**
✅ **Configure domains**
✅ **Monitor deployment health**

### 12 Powerful Tools

1. `list_projects` - See all your Vercel projects
2. `get_project` - Get detailed project info
3. `list_deployments` - View deployment history
4. `get_deployment` - Check deployment details
5. `create_deployment` - Deploy to production or preview
6. `cancel_deployment` - Stop running deployments
7. `get_deployment_logs` - Debug build issues
8. `list_env_variables` - View environment variables
9. `create_env_variable` - Add new environment variables
10. `update_env_variable` - Update existing variables
11. `delete_env_variable` - Remove variables
12. `get_project_domains` - View domain configuration

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Step 1: Configure Claude Desktop

Choose your operating system:

#### Linux (Your System)

**Quick setup (one command):**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/Claude && cat > ~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json << 'EOF'
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vercel": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/home/jdog/ai-haloween 2/vercel-mcp-server/dist/index.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "VERCEL_TOKEN": "GCPbSqXjktG1IR4a2forcN0C"
      }
    }
  }
}
EOF
```

**Or edit manually:**

```bash
nano ~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

Then paste:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vercel": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/home/jdog/ai-haloween 2/vercel-mcp-server/dist/index.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "VERCEL_TOKEN": "GCPbSqXjktG1IR4a2forcN0C"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### macOS

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude
code ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

#### Windows

```cmd
notepad %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
```

Use the same JSON configuration as above (adjust path if needed for Windows).

---

### Step 2: Restart Claude Desktop

**Completely quit and reopen Claude for Desktop.**

- On macOS/Linux: Quit the application (Cmd+Q or Ctrl+Q)
- On Windows: Exit from system tray
- Then reopen it

---

### Step 3: Verify It Works

In Claude Desktop, look for the **🔧 tools icon**. You should see Vercel tools listed.

**Test command:**

```
Show me all my Vercel projects
```

If you see a list of projects, **you're all set!** 🎉

## 🎃 Deploy AI Halloween Transform

Now that your MCP server is ready, let's deploy your app!

### Prerequisites Checklist

Before deploying, make sure you have:

- [ ] **GitHub repository** connected to Vercel (or ready to connect)
- [ ] **Supabase project** set up (already done: `twsnioiuggbyzfxajlwk`)
- [ ] **Supabase anon key** ready
- [ ] **Stripe publishable key** ready
- [ ] **Gemini API key** ready

### Deployment Workflow

#### 1. Check Your Projects

Ask Claude:

```
Show me all my Vercel projects
```

Look for "ai-halloween" or similar project name.

#### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Ask Claude:

```
I need to configure environment variables for my ai-halloween project. Can you help me add these variables for all environments (production, preview, development)?

VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://twsnioiuggbyzfxajlwk.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[paste your anon key]
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=[paste your stripe key]
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=[paste your gemini key]
```

Claude will add each variable automatically!

#### 3. Deploy to Preview First

Ask Claude:

```
Deploy ai-halloween to preview
```

Test the preview URL thoroughly before going to production.

#### 4. Deploy to Production

When preview looks good:

```
Deploy ai-halloween to production
```

#### 5. Monitor Deployment

```
What's the status of my latest ai-halloween deployment?
```

If anything goes wrong:

```
Show me the deployment logs for ai-halloween
```

---

## 💡 Example Conversations with Claude

### Check Project Status

```
What's the current status of my ai-halloween project? Show me the latest deployment and any environment variables that are configured.
```

### Debug Failed Deployment

```
My ai-halloween deployment failed. Can you show me the logs and help me figure out what went wrong?
```

### Update API Key

```
I need to rotate my Gemini API key. Can you update the VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY variable for ai-halloween and redeploy?
```

### Weekly Health Check

```
Give me a health check for ai-halloween: show me the last 5 deployments, current environment variables, and any recent errors.
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Tools Not Showing in Claude Desktop

1. **Completely quit** Claude Desktop (not just minimize)
2. Check config file location is correct for your OS
3. Verify server path is absolute: `/home/jdog/ai-haloween 2/vercel-mcp-server/dist/index.js`
4. Check Node.js is available: `which node`
5. Restart Claude Desktop again

### API Errors

- Verify your Vercel token hasn't expired
- Check you have access to the projects
- Test token manually: `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer GCPbSqXjktG1IR4a2forcN0C" https://api.vercel.com/v9/projects`

### View Logs

```bash
# Claude Desktop logs (macOS)
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log

# Claude Desktop logs (Linux)
tail -f ~/.config/Claude/logs/mcp*.log
```

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

1. ✅ **Never commit your Vercel token** to Git
2. ✅ **Rotate tokens every 90 days**
3. ✅ **Use encrypted environment variables** in Vercel for secrets
4. ✅ **Monitor token usage** in Vercel dashboard
5. ✅ **Revoke old tokens** when you rotate
6. ⚠️ **Your token has full account access** - keep it secure!

### If Your Token Is Compromised

1. Go to https://vercel.com/account/tokens
2. Find the token "MCP Server" (or the one you created)
3. Click "Delete"
4. Create a new token
5. Update your `claude_desktop_config.json` with the new token
6. Restart Claude Desktop
