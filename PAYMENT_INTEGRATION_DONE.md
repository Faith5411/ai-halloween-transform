## ðŸš€ FINAL STEPS (5 minutes):

### Step 1: Create Products in Stripe

Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/products

Create 3 products (make sure you're in **LIVE mode**):

**Product 1: Basic**
- Name: AI Halloween - Basic
- Price: $4.99 monthly
- Click "Save"

**Product 2: Pro**
- Name: AI Halloween - Pro
- Price: $12.99 monthly
- Click "Save"

**Product 3: Magic**
- Name: AI Halloween - Magic
- Price: $29.99 monthly
- Click "Save"

---

### Step 2: Create Payment Links

Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/payment-links

For **EACH** product, click "+ New":

**Settings:**
- Select product (Basic/Pro/Magic)
- After payment â†’ "Don't show confirmation page"
- Success URL: `https://your-domain.com/?success=true`
- Cancel URL: `https://your-domain.com/?canceled=true`
- Click "Create link"

**ðŸ“‹ You'll get 3 links like:**
```
https://buy.stripe.com/test_xxxxxxxxxxxxx  (Basic)
https://buy.stripe.com/test_yyyyyyyyyyyyy  (Pro)
https://buy.stripe.com/test_zzzzzzzzzzzzz  (Magic)
```

---

### Step 3: Add Links to Your App

Edit `constants-stripe.ts`:

```typescript
export const STRIPE_PAYMENT_LINKS = {
  basic: 'https://buy.stripe.com/YOUR_BASIC_LINK_HERE',
  pro: 'https://buy.stripe.com/YOUR_PRO_LINK_HERE',
  magic: 'https://buy.stripe.com/YOUR_MAGIC_LINK_HERE',
};
```

Replace with your actual links!

---

### Step 4: Build & Test

```bash
npm run build
npm run dev
```

Click "Subscribe Now" â†’ Should redirect to Stripe!

---

## ðŸ’³ How Users Subscribe:

1. User clicks "Subscribe Now" on pricing card
2. Redirected to Stripe checkout page
3. Enters credit card info
4. Stripe processes payment
5. User redirected back to your app
6. Shows success message! ðŸŽ‰

## ðŸ“Š Managing Subscriptions:

### View Payments:
https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments

### View Customers:
https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers

### Customer Portal (for users to manage subscriptions):
https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/portal

Enable this so users can:
- Update payment methods
- Cancel subscriptions
- View invoices

---

## ðŸ”’ What About Feature Locking?

Right now, all tiers can access all features (for testing).

To actually lock features by subscription:

**Option 1: Simple (Check localStorage)**
- After payment, store tier in localStorage
- Check tier before allowing custom prompts/video

**Option 2: Proper (Add Auth)**
- Use Clerk/Supabase/Auth0
- Store subscription status in database
- Check on every request

For MVP, Option 1 is fine!

---

## ðŸ’° Stripe Fees:

You'll receive:
- $4.99 plan â†’ ~$4.54 per month
- $12.99 plan â†’ ~$12.31 per month  
- $29.99 plan â†’ ~$28.82 per month

(Stripe takes 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction)
