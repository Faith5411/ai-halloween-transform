## 🎨 Customization Guide

### Change Contest Prize
```typescript
// Update prize tier in weekly_contests table
UPDATE weekly_contests
SET prize_tier = 'pro'  // or 'magic'
WHERE contest_week = '2024-52';
```

### Require Moderation
```typescript
// In supabase-gallery-setup.sql, change default:
moderation_status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending'  // Instead of 'approved'
```

### Add Featured Items
```typescript
// Manually feature items:
UPDATE gallery
SET is_featured = true
WHERE id = 'item-id';

// Then query featured items:
const featured = await fetchGalleryItems('trending', 20, 0);
// Filter by is_featured if needed
```

### Custom Voting Rules
```typescript
// Edit galleryService.ts checkUserVoted() function
// Add custom logic (e.g., require login, add cooldown)
```

---

## 📈 Success Metrics

Track these in Supabase to measure success:

```sql
-- Total gallery submissions
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM gallery WHERE is_public = true;

-- Total votes cast
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM gallery_votes;

-- Most popular transformation
SELECT * FROM gallery 
WHERE is_public = true 
ORDER BY votes_count DESC 
LIMIT 1;

-- Contest participation
SELECT contest_week, COUNT(*) as entries
FROM gallery
GROUP BY contest_week
ORDER BY contest_week DESC;

-- Weekly winner
SELECT * FROM gallery
WHERE is_winner = true
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
