## 🔧 HOW IT WORKS

### 1. Usage Tracking
- **Local Storage**: Usage is tracked in the browser using `localStorage`
- **Per User**: Each browser/device tracks separately
- **Reset Schedule**: Automatically resets on the 1st of each month
- **Real-time Updates**: Usage display updates every 10 seconds

### 2. When User Transforms
```
1. User uploads photo and selects costume
2. Clicks "Transform"
3. System checks: canTransform(tier)
4. If limit reached → Shows error with upgrade prompt
5. If under limit → Processes transform
6. Increments usage counter
7. Updates display
```

### 3. When User Reaches Limit
```
❌ Transform blocked
📊 Usage display shows: "0 / 10 left"
🚫 Error message: "Basic plan limit reached! You've used all 10 transforms..."
⏰ Shows days until reset
🚀 Upgrade button appears (if applicable)
```

### 4. Monthly Reset
```
- Automatic on 1st of month
- Usage counters reset to 0
- Full allowance restored
- No action needed by user
```

## 🎨 USER INTERFACE

### Usage Display Component
Located at top of app, shows:
- **Progress bars** for transforms and videos
- **Color coding**:
  - 🟢 Green: > 50% remaining

  - 🔴 Red: < 25% remaining
- **Current usage**: "5 / 10 transforms used"
- **Days until reset**: "Resets in 15 days"
- **Current plan badge**: Shows tier name

### Warnings
- **Low Usage Warning**: When 3 or fewer transforms left
- **Limit Reached Alert**: When 0 transforms left
- **Upgrade Prompt**: Appears when limit is reached (Basic users)

## 📈 FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

### Server-Side Tracking (Recommended)
Current implementation uses localStorage (client-side). For production:

1. **Why Server-Side?**
   - Prevent circumvention (clearing localStorage)
   - Track across devices
   - More accurate analytics
   - Better fraud prevention

2. **Implementation with Supabase:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_usage (
  user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  transforms_used INT DEFAULT 0,
  videos_used INT DEFAULT 0,
  billing_period_start DATE,
  tier TEXT,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

3. **Migration Path:**
   - Keep current localStorage as fallback
   - Add Supabase tracking for authenticated users
   - Sync on login
   - Phase out localStorage after testing

### Stripe Webhooks
- Listen for `customer.subscription.updated`
- Auto-update tier in database
- Send welcome/upgrade emails
- Track churn and retention

### Analytics
- Track which tiers use most resources
- Optimize pricing based on actual usage
- A/B test different limit structures

---

## 🔐 SECURITY NOTES

### Current Setup (LocalStorage):
- ✅ Easy to implement
- ✅ Works without backend
- ✅ Fast and responsive
- ⚠️ Can be bypassed by clearing localStorage
- ⚠️ Not synced across devices

### Recommendation:
For MVP/launch: **Current setup is fine**
For scale: **Migrate to server-side tracking**
