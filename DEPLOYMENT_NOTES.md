## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Stripe Payment Links
**Current Configuration:**
- Basic: FREE (no Stripe link needed)
- Pro: $14.99/month (payment link: ...73G05)
- Magic: $29.99/month (payment link: ...73G06)

**Note:** The Pricing.tsx component displays "$5/month" and "$10/month" but the actual Stripe payment links are for $14.99 and $29.99. Consider updating Stripe products to match displayed prices, or update displayed prices to match Stripe.

**Action Required:** Decide on final pricing:
- Option A: Update Stripe products to $5 and $10
- Option B: Update Pricing.tsx to show $14.99 and $29.99

### Contest vs Giveaway Terminology
All user-facing text now uses "giveaway" instead of "contest" to better reflect the prize structure with multiple winners per week.

Database tables still use "weekly_contests" name for consistency with existing data. Consider renaming in future migration if needed.
