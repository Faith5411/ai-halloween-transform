8. Success message! ✅
```

```
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Database → Table Editor → gallery
3. You should see your transformation

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Supabase not configured"
**Fix:** Check `.env` file has correct values:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://twsnioiuggbyzfxajlwk.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
```

### Gallery items not showing
**Fix:** Check moderation status:
```sql
SELECT * FROM gallery 
WHERE moderation_status = 'approved' 
AND is_public = true;
```

### Can't vote twice (expected!)
This is **correct behavior**! Anti-cheat is working.

To reset for testing:
```sql
DELETE FROM gallery_votes WHERE gallery_id = 'your-test-item-id';
```

### SQL schema errors
**Fix:** Make sure you copied the ENTIRE file.
The schema is 400+ lines and must be complete.
