## ⚠️ ACTION REQUIRED: Run SQL Schema

**The database schema has NOT been executed yet.** You need to run it manually:

### Option 1: Supabase Dashboard (Recommended - 5 minutes)

1. **Open:** https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/twsnioiuggbyzfxajlwk
2. **Click:** SQL Editor (left sidebar)
3. **Click:** New query
4. **Copy:** Entire contents of `supabase-gallery-setup.sql`
5. **Paste:** Into SQL Editor
6. **Click:** Run (or Ctrl+Enter)
7. **Verify:** "Success. No rows returned" message

### Option 2: Using Supabase CLI

```bash
# If you have Supabase CLI installed
cd "ai-haloween 2"
./run-gallery-setup.sh

# Or manually with psql
psql "your-connection-string" -f supabase-gallery-setup.sql
```

### Why Manual Execution?

The Supabase MCP requires authentication credentials (service role key or access token) which should remain private and not be exposed in this environment. Manual execution via the Supabase Dashboard is the safest and most straightforward approach.

---

## ✅ Verification Steps (After Running SQL)

Run these queries in Supabase SQL Editor:

### 1. Check Tables
```sql
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('gallery', 'gallery_votes', 'gallery_reports', 'weekly_contests');
```
**Expected:** 4 rows

### 2. Check Storage Bucket
```sql
SELECT * FROM storage.buckets WHERE id = 'gallery';
```
**Expected:** 1 row (public = true)

### 3. Check RPC Functions
```sql
SELECT routine_name FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_schema = 'public' 
AND routine_name IN (
  'increment_gallery_votes', 'decrement_gallery_votes', 
  'increment_gallery_views', 'get_current_contest_week', 
  'get_weekly_top_entries'
);
```
**Expected:** 5 rows

---

## 🚀 Testing Your Gallery (After SQL Setup)

### Step 1: Start the App
```bash
cd "ai-haloween 2"
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Test Share Flow
1. Upload a photo
2. Select a costume (e.g., Vampire)
3. Click "Transform"
4. Wait for transformation
5. **Hover over result** → Purple "Share" button appears
6. Click "Share to Gallery"
7. Preview modal opens
8. Click "Share to Gallery" in modal
9. Success! 🎉

### Step 3: Verify in Database
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Database → Table Editor → `gallery`
3. Your submission should appear with:
   - ✅ `moderation_status = 'approved'`
   - ✅ `is_public = true`
   - ✅ `contest_week` auto-assigned
   - ✅ `votes_count = 0` (initially)

### Step 4: Test Voting
1. View landing page (add to your app routing)
2. See your transformation in gallery
3. Click heart button (❤️)
4. Vote count increases to 1
5. Button becomes disabled (already voted)
6. Try voting again → Prevented by anti-cheat! ✅

## 🎯 Integration with Your App

### Add Landing Page to Routes

```tsx
import LandingPage from './components/LandingPage';

// In your App.tsx or router:
function App() {
  const [showLanding, setShowLanding] = useState(true);
  
  return (
    <>
      {showLanding ? (
        <LandingPage onGetStarted={() => setShowLanding(false)} />
      ) : (
        <YourMainApp />
      )}
    </>
  );
}
```

### Share Button is Already Integrated

- ✅ Share button appears on hover over generated images
- ✅ Modal trigger already added to `App.tsx`
- ✅ `ResultDisplay.tsx` updated with purple Share button
- ✅ Works with both images and videos

);

-- 2. Mark as winner (replace 'winner-id')
UPDATE gallery 
SET is_winner = true, winner_tier = 'basic'
WHERE id = 'winner-id';

-- 3. Update contest
UPDATE weekly_contests
SET winner_id = 'winner-id', winner_announced_at = NOW()
